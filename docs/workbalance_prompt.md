Fluxa → WorkBalance (WB) AI Rebuild Prompt

ROLE:
You are a senior product architect, UX strategist, and HR-tech domain expert.

GOAL:
Rebuild the existing Fluxa admin panel into a dedicated WorkBalance (WB) platform.

CORE TRANSFORMATION:
- Everything that currently exists as “Admin Panel” in Fluxa becomes the EMPLOYER SIDE in WorkBalance.
- AI must DESIGN, STRUCTURE, and POPULATE a completely NEW FRONT-SIDE for EMPLOYEES.
- This is NOT a technical document. This is a PRODUCT, BUSINESS, and EXPERIENCE document.

MANDATORY RULES:
- Remove all Fluxa-specific, irrelevant, or generic admin features.
- Rename EVERYTHING (modules, tables, columns, permissions, labels) to match WorkBalance terminology.
- HR, wellness, productivity, burnout prevention, engagement, and performance health are the core themes.
- Think like a product owner, not a developer.

USER ROLES:
1. Employer (Company / HR / Manager)
2. Employee (Individual user powered by AI)

EMPLOYER SIDE (ex-Admin Panel):
Rename and rebuild existing admin modules into:
- Company Profile & Culture
- Teams & Departments
- Workload Oversight
- Burnout Risk Dashboard
- Engagement Analytics
- AI Reports & Insights
- Anonymous Feedback Inbox
- Policy & Well-being Programs
- Alerts & Intervention Suggestions

EMPLOYEE FRONT-SIDE (AI-CREATED):
AI must design these from scratch:
- Personal Well-being Dashboard
- Daily Mood & Energy Check-ins
- AI Burnout Coach
- Workload Self-Reflection
- Anonymous Feedback to Employer
- Stress Signals & Warnings
- Micro-Recovery Exercises
- Personal Progress Timeline
- Trust & Privacy Controls

AI BEHAVIOR:
- AI actively analyzes patterns, not just displays data.
- AI explains insights in human language.
- AI avoids corporate jargon.
- AI prioritizes psychological safety.

DATA & TERMINOLOGY CHANGES:
- “Users” → Employees
- “Admins” → Employers
- “Logs” → Well-being Signals
- “Reports” → Health Insights
- “Warnings” → Care Signals
- “Performance” → Sustainable Output

REMOVE COMPLETELY:
- Generic CRM logic
- Financial dashboards
- Marketing modules
- Permission clutter
- Anything unrelated to human well-being

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Full rebuilt product vision for WorkBalance
- Clear separation of Employer vs Employee experiences
- Meaningful naming system
- Emotionally intelligent UX logic
- AI-driven but human-first design

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT:
This must feel like a WELL-BEING PRODUCT — not an admin tool.
